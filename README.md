# 🎙️ Voice Journal

**Voice Journal** is a smart, voice-first journaling app built with **React Native (Expo)** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to record voice entries, converts them into text using Speech-to-Text (STT), analyzes their mood using AI sentiment detection, and stores all entries locally using SQLite. Users can reflect on their thoughts, replay recordings, and track emotional trends over time.
